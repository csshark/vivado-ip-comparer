<h4>Usage:</h4>

<p>It's basic script, that "automates" manual proccess of finding changes in upgraded files via new version of Vivado. It is a bonus step in migration process that might save some time and make it easier to go on higher version.<p>

<p><b>Note: </b>This tool is going to be included in my future FPGA projects. It is highly recommended to clone project from source and there is no need for external tools.</p>
